# üìä Midterm Project: Predicting Profit Margins Using SuperStore Data  

As part of the Zoomcamp organized by DataCamp, I had the opportunity to select and analyze a dataset of personal or professional interest. Leveraging my background as a finance analyst, I chose the **SuperStore dataset**, a rich source of transactional data, to explore and solve real-world business challenges.

## üîç **Project Objective**  

The primary goal of this project is to analyze SuperStore's transactional data to uncover key financial insights and build predictive models that can forecast **profit margins** for various products. This analysis is designed to enhance decision-making in areas such as:  
- **Inventory management**  
- **Pricing strategies**  
- **Customer segmentation**

## üõ† **Problem Statement**  

This project focuses on providing actionable insights into SuperStore's business operations and financial performance. By exploring this dataset, the analysis uncovers drivers of sales and profitability, with an emphasis on:  
- Customer segments  
- Product categories  
- Discounting practices  
- Regional performance  

### **Key Goals**:  
1. **Identifying Financial Drivers**  
   - Analyze customer demographics, discounting practices, and regional sales performance.  
   - Highlight variables that significantly impact revenue and profitability, identifying high-value areas for growth.  

2. **Developing Predictive Models**  
   - **Linear Regression**: Predict profit margins based on features like sales quantity, discounts, and costs.  
   - **Logistic Regression**: Classify orders as profitable or non-profitable.  
   - These models will aid in forecasting, inventory planning, and strategic marketing decisions.  

3. **Providing Actionable Recommendations**  
   - Data-driven strategies to optimize revenue and profitability, focusing on:  
     - Refining discount policies.  
     - Targeting high-value customer segments.  
     - Streamlining inventory management.

## üìÇ **Dataset Overview**  

The **SuperStore dataset** contains transactional records with the following features:  
- **Order and Shipping Details**:  
  - Order date, ship date, and processing time.  
- **Customer and Product Information**:  
  - Product category, subcategory, customer segment, and manufacturer.  
- **Financial Metrics**:  
  - Selling price, discounts, costs, and profits.  

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of SuperStore‚Äôs transactions, enabling in-depth financial and operational analysis.

## üöÄ **Project Workflow**  

The project follows these structured steps:  

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and scaling features.  
   - Transforming discounts from percentages to absolute values and deriving key metrics like cost per unit.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing patterns and trends to uncover insights into sales and profitability.  

3. **Validation Framework**  
   - Establishing a robust framework to train and evaluate models.  

4. **Model Building and Training**  
   - Developing and fine-tuning linear regression and logistic regression models.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
